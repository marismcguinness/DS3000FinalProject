        "### 1.1 Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "The project tackles the issue of anemia in women as a common illness that does not get enough attention. Anemia results from a lack of specific nutrients and vitamins and occurs when there is not enough consumption of animal products, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and beans. According to the report written by Camila Borda (2013), as a developing country Bolivia is facing negative changes in the eating behavior of people, they consume more \"empty\" calories and junk food. Therefore, there might be an increased prevalence of anemia here.\n",
        "We want to identify to what extent the sociocultural environment affects the health of women and to what extent they are willing to treat the illness. This might help to have a better understanding of the importance of government and global organizations' aids to fight anemia.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Significance of the Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Anemia causes daily headaches, dizziness, weakness, vision problems, and bones and joints pain (Khatri, 2019). Women are a high-risk group, also, it is likely that the child of a woman with anemia will inherit the disorder. Therefore, anemia treatment is important to prevent future health issues of the entire population.\n",
        "The report says that food issues of Bolivia are common for most of the Latin American countries. Therefore, it is important to study the health care issues in this developing countries, espacially when the disorder is also common for developed states like US. We believe that people's awareness will have significant role in preventing health problems.\n",
        "The dataset we have used was analyzed to explore the social impact on anemia level. The research has found how gender roles, education and language affect getting healthcare service. \n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.3 Questions\n",
        "Based on the presented problem, we aimed to answer some key questions on what factors determine anemia:\n",
        "* How do the gender roles in family affect women's health?\n",
        "* To what extent are Bolivian women aware of anemia?\n",
        "* To what extent do women treat anemia as a serious disorder?\n",
        "* How do reproductive status and age affect women's health?\n",
        "* Would Gaussian Naive-Bayes give falsely accurate predictions if the variables we used are inter-dependent?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.4 Hypothesis\n",
        "The following hypothesis was developed as well:\n",
        "* Women living in rural areas are less likely to seek anemia treatment pills compared to women from town areas.\n"

        "This figure shows a stacked Histogram of the education distribution amongst Bolivian women. The red Histogram represents the distrubution amongst women with Anemia, while the gray Histogram represents the distrubution amongst women without Anemia. The distributions of both Histograms are very similar. Interestingly, the median years of education for women with anemia (5 years) is one year greater than the median years of education for women with anemia (4 years). This suggests that Anemic women in Bolivia are more educated than women without anemia, however, this is not conclusive evidence.\n",

        "This figure shows a stacked Histogram of the age distribution amongst Bolivian women. The red Histogram represents the distrubution amongst women with Anemia, while the gray Histogram represents the distrubution amongst women without Anemia. The distributions of both Histograms are very similar, showing two peaks centered around the ages of 22-23 years and 34-35 years. Interesting, the age distribution of women with anemia is skewed very slightly more so to the right than the age distribution of women without anemia. According to the American Society of Hematology, the risk of anemia increases as women get older.\n",

The pills prediction showed a larger differnce with a training set score of 74.13% and testing set score of 55.00%.

        "## 4. DISCUSSION\n",
        "Several steps were taken to analyze the anemia dataset and make informed predictions from the analysis. After performing basic data cleaning to remove null values, an initial data analysis was performed. Grouping the data allowed for the performance of hypothesis tests and creation of visualizations. In order to create two predictive models—one for predicting anemia and the other for predicting if the subject will seek treatment—several supervised machine learning classification algorithms were compared. After identifying decision tree classification as the highest-performing algorithm for both models, further model optimization was performed. This included training and testing, recursive feature selection, and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. Using the combined results from descriptive statistics, data visualization, and machine learning, several conclusions were made about which anemia treatment policies could be most effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Chi-Square Test is used to test hypothesis because it determines if variables are related to each other. In this case, p value (0,035) is smaller than 0,05 that means that there is a relationship between the location of participant and her treatment. Thus our null hypothesis is supported. Also, we have calculated Chi-Square statistic value (X^2) of 6,69 that summarizes the difference between data and independence hypothesis. The value is not large therefore we may assume that hypothesis is accepted.\n",
        "\n",
        "In constructing the machine learning classification models, four algorithms were compared using cross-validation: k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, and Decision Tree. For the anemia predictive model, Gaussian Naïve Bayes appeared to perform the best with a high mean accuracy. However, the naïve assumption that all features were independent would not work with this dataset—several sociocultural factors were likely related. Thus, the Decision Tree classifier was chosen as the next highest-performing algorithm. In the case of the pills-sought predictive model, the Decision Tree classifier had the highest mean accuracy and was chosen for the model’s algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additional conclusions could be made about the dataset after performing feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. Throughout all model optimization, prediction accuracies ranging from 50% to 70% were achieved, indicating that the available features provide some level of insightful predictions, but more data is required to develop robust predictive models. In predicting anemia, four key features were selected: years of education, age, answer to “For whom is anemia most serious?” and “How serious is anemia?” For predicting if the subject would seek pills, two features were selected: hemoglobin level and the answer to \"What is anemia?\" In both models, these features indicate that individual perception on the severity of anemia aids in predicting if an individual will have anemia and if they will attempt to seek a prescribed treatment. Based on this, it is recommended that policies on anemia treatment should first focus on educating at-risk women on anemia before attempting to enforce a treatment that ultimately will not be sought.\n",
        "\n",
        "Several improvements could be made in future works related to the topic of anemia prediction in at-risk regions. A key improvement would be to obtain more data as this would potentially improve the prediction accuracy of the models and allow additional sociocultural features to be explored. It would also be useful to perform an analysis on the hemoglobin level of an individual at the beginning and end of the study to determine effectiveness of the prescribed treatment. This lack of available data has proven to be an issue in other studies, especially in those focused on developing countries, but more datasets are likely to become available over time as awareness on the issue is increased."
